# [Het Hornemann Huis](https://hethornemannhuis.nl/) Interactive Video

## About

- This is a choose-your-own-adventure video experience for Het Hornemann Huis, a history museum that tells the tragic story of what the Hornemann family went through during the Second World War.
- The goal was to get young people more interested in history, and make them think about the dilemma's that people had to face during the war. The product was this interactive experience, where the audience gets presented a story sequence which ends with a dilemma.
- People can then vote on which choice they would have made with their phones, and see the results of the poll afterwards. The most voted answer decides what the next sequence will be, and what the eventual outcome of the story will be.
